# Codex Quickstarts

Codex Quickstarts is a collection of projects designed to help developers quickly get started with building applications using the OpenAI API. Each quickstart provides a foundation that you can easily build upon and customize for your specific needs.

## Getting Started

To use these quickstarts, you'll need an OpenAI API key. If you don't have one yet, you can sign up at [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com).

## Available Quickstarts

### Customer Support Agent

A customer support agent powered by OpenAI. This project demonstrates how to leverage OpenAI's natural language understanding and generation capabilities to create an AI-assisted customer support system with access to a knowledge base.
